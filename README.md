# Favorite Fonts - Chingu Solo Project

## Overview
Create a web app displaying fonts to demonstrate and improve upon skills. Done as a part of the Chingu Explorer Solo Project.

## To-Do (Tier 2)
*Structure*
- [x] Header with minor navigation *(Logo and Catalog/Featured/Articles/About link list)*
- [ ] Nav with Major navigation / page-manipulation *(search, custom text, font-size, dark/light mode, grid/list mode, and reset)*
- [ ] Main section for the font cards
- [ ] Font cards which display the Font Name, the sample text, and an add button (the font creator is **not** available via the api, so it is not required in tiers 2 or 3)
- [ ] Back-to-top button that allows users to click and scroll back up to the top *(there could be up to 959 fonts displayed, so you need this!)*
- [ ] Footer section with your developer information

*Style*
- [ ] Sample text in each card should be displayed in the corresponding font
- [ ] Buttons/links should be evident (make sure the cursor changes, etc.)
- [ ] Implement a way to handle overflow from sample text in the font cards, as the font size is adjustable

*Functionality*
- [ ] Text typed into the custom text (type something) box should immediately change the sample text in each font card
- [ ] The sample text should return to the default sample if the input box (type something) no longer has any input
- [ ] Font size chooser should have at least four sizes and should immediately change the sample text font size in each font card
- [ ] Implement the clickable 'reset' icon on the far right of the major navigation; it should reset the page as if the page were reloaded *(do not actually reset the page)*
- [ ] On load, the page should display fonts sorted by current popularity, as returned by the Google Fonts Developer API *(see below)*
- [ ] The search feature should be fully functional and should display matching fonts (it's up to you if you want to do this via a 'submit' or through onchange)
- [ ] When the search input is cleared (via reset button or manually), the fonts should automaticaly display sorted by poplarity again

*Other*
- [ ] Your repo needs to have a robust README.md
- [ ] Make sure that there are no errors in the developer console before submitting

**Extras (Not Required)**

- [ ] Make your design fully responsive (small/large/portrait/landscape, etc.)
- [ ] Implement the light/dark mode toggle buttons
- [ ] Implement the change display icon so you can flip between a grid layout and a list layout for the font cards
- [ ] Make the 'add-font' icon add the font to a list (localHost, Cache API, etc) for front-end persistence; users can then delete the font from the list
