# Favorite Fonts - Chingu Solo Project

## Overview
Create a web app displaying fonts to demonstrate and improve upon skills. Done as a part of the Chingu Explorer Solo Project.

## To-Do (Tier 1)
Structure

- [x] Header with minor navigation (Logo and Catalog/Featured/Articles/About link list)
- [ ] Nav with Major navigation / page-manipulation (search, custom text, font-size, dark/light mode, grid/list mode, and reset)
- [ ] Main section to contain the font cards
- [ ] Font cards which display the Font Name, the font creator, the sample text, and an add button
- [ ] Footer section with your developer information

Style

- [ ] Sample text in each card should be displayed in the corresponding font
- [ ] Buttons/links should be evident (make sure the cursor changes, etc.)
- [ ] Implement a way to handle overflow from sample text in font cards, as the font size is adjustable

Functionality

- [ ] Text typed into the custom text (type something) box should immediately change the sample text displayed in each font card
- [ ] The sample text should return to the default sample if the input box (type something) no longer has any input (ex. input == "")
- [ ] Font size chooser should have at least four sizes and should immediately change the sample text font size in each font card
- [ ] Implement the clickable 'reset' icon on the far right of the major navigation; it should make the page appear as if the user reloaded the page (do not actually reload the page)

Other

- [ ] Your repo needs to have a robust README.md
- [ ] Make sure that there are no errors in the developer console before submitting

Extras (Not Required)

- [ ] Include a back-to-top button that allows users to scroll to the top once the top of the page is out of view
- [ ] Make your design fully responsive (small/large/portrait/landscape, etc.)
- [ ] Implement the light/dark mode toggle buttons
- [ ] Implement the change display icon so you can flip between a grid and list layout for the font cards
